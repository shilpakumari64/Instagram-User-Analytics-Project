# Instagram User Analytics Readme

## Description

User analysis is a critical process that allows us to track user engagement and interactions with our digital product, in this case, Instagram. By extracting valuable insights, we can support marketing, product, and development teams in making informed decisions. These insights contribute to the launch of effective marketing campaigns, feature prioritization, measurement of app success through user engagement, and overall business growth.

In this project, I had the opportunity to collaborate with the product team at Instagram. The product manager assigned me the task of providing insights on specific questions posed by the management team. This README presents a detailed report addressing those questions and delivering the requested insights.

## A) Marketing Insights

### Rewarding Most Loyal Users

The marketing team aims to reward the most loyal users of the Instagram platform. To accomplish this, I performed a query on the provided database to identify the five oldest users of Instagram. Their details will be shared with the marketing team for further actions.

### Reminding Inactive Users to Start Posting

To encourage inactive users to start posting, the marketing team plans to send promotional emails. My task was to identify users who have never posted a single photo on Instagram. The list of these users will be used to initiate the email campaign and motivate them to share their first photo.

### Declaring Contest Winner

In order to declare the contest winner, who will be determined by the most likes on a single photo, I analyzed the relevant data. I successfully identified the winner of the contest and provided their details to the team.

### Hashtag Researching

A partner brand is interested in knowing which hashtags to use in their posts to maximize reach on the Instagram platform. To assist them, I conducted research and identified the top five most commonly used hashtags on the platform. These suggestions will guide the partner brand in optimizing their hashtag strategy.

### Launch AD Campaign

The marketing team wants to determine the best day to launch their advertising campaign. To address this, I analyzed user registration patterns to identify the day of the week when the highest number of users register on Instagram. This insight will help the team schedule their ad campaign effectively.

## B) Investor Metrics

### User Engagement

Investors are interested in assessing the level of user engagement on Instagram. To provide insights on this metric, I calculated the average number of posts made by users on Instagram. Additionally, I determined the total number of photos on Instagram in relation to the total number of users.

### Bots & Fake Accounts

The investors are concerned about the presence of bots and fake accounts on the platform. To address this, I analyzed user behavior and identified users who have liked every single photo on the site. This data serves as an indicator of potential bot or fake accounts, as it is unlikely for a normal user to achieve this level of engagement.

## Conclusion

This project allowed me to delve into Instagram User Analytics and provide valuable insights to the marketing and investor teams. By addressing the specific questions posed, we gained insights on rewarding loyal users, encouraging inactive users, contest winner declaration, hashtag research, launching ad campaigns, user engagement metrics, and identifying potential bot or fake accounts.

By leveraging data-driven decision-making, we can support the growth and success of Instagram. If you have any questions or would like to collaborate on similar projects, please feel free to reach out.
